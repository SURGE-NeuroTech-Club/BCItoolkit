# Tasks/To-Do's:

The goal of this repo/library is to make a toolkit for making SSVEP/ERP-based brain-computer interfaces accessible for those who don't have much/any experience.


**Preprocessing:**
- [X] Split into Segmenting, Filters, Other(?)
  - [ ] Test Segmentation.py
    - Overlapping data issues? -> better way to implement segmentation? (just have `get_data` module??)
  - [ ] Test Filtering.py -> validate the results in processing_test.ipynb
- Artifact removal  
  - Based on amplitude
  - EOG artifact removal?

**Stim_Pres:**


#### Completed:
- [X] Add function to measure refresh rate and give a list of all possible flicker frequencies for your screen!


# Notes:

**Cyton Board**: streams data in 24 channels
- 1-8 = EEG
- 9-11 = Accelerometer Channels
- 13+ Aux Channels(?)

Brainflow has it's own filtering/ML?
